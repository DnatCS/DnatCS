I am a recent cybersecurity bootcamp graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems. I started my cybersecurity journey at the start of 2024 due in partly to my interest in technology, but its safe to say I have been enjoying it ever since. I had just received my Security+ and am working on getting my Network+ soon. I still have so much that I need to learn, but I will be utilizing github to showcase what and how I've been learning. 

## Objective

My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, specifically aiming to join a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst.
